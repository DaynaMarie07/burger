Eat-Da-Sequalized-Burger
This project was homework for the UNCC Coding Boot Camp. The goal was to revise the previous Eat-Da-Burger assignment by using Sequelize as the ORM.

Getting Started
Clone or download this repo to your local system.

Prerequisites
Both of these will need to be installed and running:

Node.js
MySQL
Installing
To load all required NPM packages, navigate to the new folder in your terminal window and run

npm install
You will need to create a MySQL database called 'burgers_db'. Within the the db folder, you will find 'schema.sql' to create the database & table. If you wish, 'seeds.sql' contains a few sample records to get you started.

To start Express web server, in your terminal window run

node server
Running the tests
To use the app, open your browser and navigate to

http://localhost:8080/index
You should see something like this:
